## Poker Engine

This repository contains an implementation of a poker engine that I wrote when I was first learning C++. I used it to explore `<algorithm>`, templates, classes, friends, inheritance (both single and multiple) when implementing hands, boost::variant, shared pointers, the Barton-Nackman trick, and SFINAE.
